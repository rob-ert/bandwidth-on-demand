    Open Grid Forum NSI Connection Services Protocol v1.0

    Description: This is a draft version of service definitions for the
    reference web services implementation of the OGF NSI Connection Services
    Protocol v1.0. Comments and questions can be directed to the mailing list
    group mailing list (nsi-wg@ogf.org).

    This document is the SOAP endpoint definition for a provider NSA.  It
    holds definitions for messages the provider NSA will receive.  For the
    reserve, provision, release, and terminate message sets the provider
    will receive request messages only.  For the query operation a provider
    NSA must support request, confirmed, and failed messages due to the
    possibility that a provider NSA may query the requester for a list of
    connection reservations.-->

  <!--OGF NSI protocol 1.0 description-->
  <wsdl:documentation>This is a web services message definition of OGF NSI Connection
        Services protocol version 1.0 based on an HTTP/SOAP binding. The
        Connection Service is message based request-response protocol
        that operates between a Requester Network Service Agent (NSA)
        and a Provider NSA. The protocol includes a set of defined
        primitives that are intended to provide the control necessary to
        manage Connections.
    
        There are five primitives supported in this version of the
        protocol:
    
        1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
        connection between two STP’s constrained by certain service
        parameters.
    
        2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
        reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
        the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
        the requested service.
    
        3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        without removing the reservation.
        
        4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        and terminate the reservation.
    
        5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
        set of connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
        This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.
    
        6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA when
        an existing reservation is administratively terminated before the
        reservation's scheduled end-time.
    
        The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
        each primitive consists of three operations:
    
        1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
        such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
        NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
        the future.
    
        2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
        response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
        NSA that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").
    
        3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
        message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
        issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").
    
        To fit this asynchronous NSI protocol into a synchronous SOAP
        over HTTP binding we require each of the Requester and Provider
        NSA to implement SOAP end points. Request messages are sent from
        the Requester NSA to the Provider NSA's SOAP end point, while
        Confirmed and Failed messages are sent from the Provider NSA to
        the Requester NSA SOAP end point. In addition, each of the
        Request, Confirmed, and Failed operations are defined with
        input (request), output (acknowledgment), and fault (error)
        messages as part of their WSDL definition. The output message,
        or response, for each operation is an element definition providing a
        simple acknowledgment with the request correlationId.
        
        Note on acknowledgment handling:
        Depending on NSA implementation and thread timing an acknowledgment to
        a request operation may be returned after the confirm/fail for the
        request has been returned to the Requesting NSA.
        
        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are proposed:
        
        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be able to accept
        confirm/fail before acknowledgment.
        
        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before the
        confirm/fail.
    
        Each NSI CS request message in this WSDL definition has the
        following elements:
    
        correlationId - An identifier provided by the requesting
        NSA used to correlate to an asynchronous response from the
        responder. It is recommended that a Universally Unique
        Identifier (UUID) URN as per IETF RFC 4122 be used as a
        globally unique value.
    
        replyTo - The Requester NSA's SOAP end point address to which the
        asynchronous Confirmed or Failed message associated with this
        request will be delivered.
    
        parameters - Operation specific parameters as defined in the NSI CS
        protocol independent XML schema specification.</wsdl:documentation>

                        Notes on acknowledgment:
                        Depending on NSA implementation and thread timing an
                        acknowledgment to a request operation may be returned
                        after the confirm/fail for the request has been returned
                        to the Requesting NSA.
                        
                        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are
                        proposed:
                        
                        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be
                        able to accept confirm/fail before acknowledgment.
                        
                        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before
                        the confirm/fail.</xsd:documentation>

    <xsd:documentation xml:lang="en">This is an XML schema document describing the OGF NSI Connection
            Services protocol version 1.0. The Connection Service is message
            based command protocol that operates between a Requester
            Network Service Agent (NSA) and a Provider NSA. The protocol includes
            a set of defined primitives that are intended to provide the control
            necessary to manage Connections.

            There are five primitives supported in this version of the
            protocol:

            1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
            connection between two STP's constrained by a certain service
            parameters.

            2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
            reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
            the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
            the requested service.

            3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            without removing the reservation.

            4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            and terminate the reservation.

            5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
            set of connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
            This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.

            6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA
            when an existing reservation is administratively terminated before
            the reservation's scheduled end-time.

            The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
            each primitive consists of three operations:

            1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
            such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
            NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
            the future.

            2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
            response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
            NSA that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").

            3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
            message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
            issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").</xsd:documentation>

                validator and only simple additional checks need to be added.
                This type definition checks that the time part ends with a "Z"

    Open Grid Forum NSI Connection Services Protocol v1.0

    Description: This is a draft version of service definitions for the
    reference web services implementation of the OGF NSI Connection Services
    Protocol v1.0. Comments and questions can be directed to the mailing list
    group mailing list (nsi-wg@ogf.org).
    
    This document is the SOAP endpoint definition for a requester NSA and
    holds definitions for messages the requester NSA will receive.  For the
    reserve, provision, release, and terminate message sets the requester
    will receive confirmed and failed messages only.  For the query operation
    a requester NSA must support request, confirmed, and failed messages due
    to the possibility that a child provider NSA may query the requester for
    a list of connection reservations.  The requester NSA may also receive
    the forcedEnd message.-->

  <!--OGF NSI protocol 1.0 description-->
  <wsdl:documentation>This is a web services message definition of OGF NSI Connection
        Services protocol version 1.0 based on an HTTP/SOAP binding. The
        Connection Service is message based request-response protocol
        that operates between a Requester Network Service Agent (NSA)
        and a Provider NSA. The protocol includes a set of defined
        primitives that are intended to provide the control necessary to
        manage Connections.
    
        There are five primitives supported in this version of the
        protocol:
    
        1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
        connection between two STP’s constrained by certain service
        parameters.
    
        2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
        reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
        the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
        the requested service.
    
        3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        without removing the reservation.
        
        4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        and terminate the reservation.
    
        5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
        set of connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
        This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.
    
        6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA when
        an existing reservation is administratively terminated before the
        reservation's scheduled end-time.
    
        The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
        each primitive consists of three operations:
    
        1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
        such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
        NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
        the future.
    
        2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
        response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
        NSA that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").
    
        3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
        message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
        issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").
    
        To fit this asynchronous NSI protocol into a synchronous SOAP
        over HTTP binding we require each of the Requester and Provider
        NSA to implement SOAP end points. Request messages are sent from
        the Requester NSA to the Provider NSA's SOAP end point, while
        Confirmed and Failed messages are sent from the Provider NSA to
        the Requester NSA SOAP end point. In addition, each of the
        Request, Confirmed, and Failed operations are defined with
        input (request), output (acknowledgment), and fault (error)
        messages as part of their WSDL definition. The output message,
        or response, for each operation is an element definition providing a
        simple acknowledgment with the request correlationId.
        
        Note on acknowledgment handling:
        Depending on NSA implementation and thread timing an acknowledgment to
        a request operation may be returned after the confirm/fail for the
        request has been returned to the Requesting NSA.
        
        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are proposed:
        
        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be able to accept
        confirm/fail before acknowledgment.
        
        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before the
        confirm/fail.
    
        Each NSI CS request message in this WSDL definition has the
        following elements:
    
        correlationId - An identifier provided by the requesting
        NSA used to correlate to an asynchronous response from the
        responder. It is recommended that a Universally Unique
        Identifier (UUID) URN as per IETF RFC 4122 be used as a
        globally unique value.
    
        replyTo - The Requester NSA's SOAP end point address to which the
        asynchronous Confirmed or Failed message associated with this
        request will be delivered.
    
        parameters - Operation specific parameters as defined in the NSI CS
        protocol independent XML schema specification.</wsdl:documentation>

                        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are
                        proposed:
                        
                        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be
                        able to accept confirm/fail before acknowledgment.
                        
                        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before
                        the confirm/fail.</xsd:documentation>

  <xsd:annotation>
    <xsd:documentation xml:lang="en">This is an XML schema document describing the OGF NSI Connection
            Services protocol version 1.0. The Connection Service is message
            based command protocol that operates between a Requester
            Network Service Agent (NSA) and a Provider NSA. The protocol includes
            a set of defined primitives that are intended to provide the control
            necessary to manage Connections.

            There are five primitives supported in this version of the
            protocol:

            1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
            connection between two STP's constrained by a certain service
            parameters.

            2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
            reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
            the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
            the requested service.

            3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            without removing the reservation.

            4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            and terminate the reservation.

            5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
            set of connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
            This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.

            6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA
            when an existing reservation is administratively terminated before
            the reservation's scheduled end-time.

            The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
            each primitive consists of three operations:

            1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
            such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
            NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
            the future.

            2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
            response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
            NSA that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").

            3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
            message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
            issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").</xsd:documentation>
