    for a provider NSA. It holds definitions for messages the provider NSA will receive. 
    For the reserve, provision, release, and terminate message sets the provider will 
    receive request messages only. For the query operation a provider NSA must support 
    request, confirmed, and failed messages due to the possibility that a provider NSA 
    may query the requester for a list of connection reservations.-->

  <!--OGF NSI protocol 1.0 description-->
  <wsdl:documentation>This is a web services message definition of OGF NSI
        Connection
        Services protocol version 1.0 based on an HTTP/SOAP binding.
        The
        Connection Service is message based request-response protocol
        that
        operates between a Requester Network Service Agent (NSA)
        and a Provider
        NSA. The protocol includes a set of defined
        primitives that are intended
        to provide the control necessary to
        manage Connections.

        There are five primitives supported in this version of the
        protocol:

        1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
        connection between
        two STP’s constrained by certain service
        parameters.

        2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
        reservation
        (associated with a previous reserve message) on
        the Requester NSA's
        behalf but subject to the constraints of
        the requested service.

        3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        without
        removing the reservation.

        4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        and
        terminate the reservation.

        5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
        set of
        connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
        This message can be
        used as a status polling mechanism.

        6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA when
        an existing
        reservation is administratively terminated before the
        reservation's
        scheduled end-time.

        The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
        each primitive
        consists of three operations:

        1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
        such as
        "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
        NSA can expect an
        response to the request at some point in
        the future.

        2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
        response message
        (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
        NSA that issued the
        original request message ("reserveRequest").

        3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
        message (such
        as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
        issued the original request
        message ("reserveRequest").

        To fit this asynchronous NSI protocol into a synchronous SOAP
        over HTTP binding
        we require each of the Requester and Provider
        NSA to implement SOAP end
        points. Request messages are sent from
        the Requester NSA to the Provider
        NSA's SOAP end point, while
        Confirmed and Failed messages are sent from
        the Provider NSA to
        the Requester NSA SOAP end point. In addition, each
        of the
        Request, Confirmed, and Failed operations are defined with
        input
        (request), output (acknowledgment), and fault (error)
        messages as part of
        their WSDL definition. The output message,
        or response, for each
        operation is an element definition providing a
        simple acknowledgment with
        the request correlationId.

        Note on acknowledgment handling:
        Depending on NSA implementation and thread timing
        an acknowledgment to
        a request operation may be returned after the
        confirm/fail for the
        request has been returned to the Requesting NSA.

        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are proposed:

        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be able to accept
        confirm/fail
        before acknowledgment.

        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before the
        confirm/fail.

        Each NSI CS request message in this WSDL definition has the
        following elements:

        correlationId - An identifier provided by the requesting
        NSA used to
        correlate to an asynchronous response from the
        responder. It is
        recommended that a Universally Unique
        Identifier (UUID) URN as per IETF
        RFC 4122 be used as a
        globally unique value.

        replyTo - The Requester NSA's SOAP end point address to which the
        asynchronous
        Confirmed or Failed message associated with this
        request will be
        delivered.

        parameters - Operation specific parameters as defined in the NSI CS
        protocol independent
        XML schema specification.</wsdl:documentation>

                        acknowledgment to a request
                        operation may be returned

                        to the Requesting NSA.

                        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are
                        proposed:

                        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be
                        able to accept
                        confirm/fail before acknowledgment.

                        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before
                        the confirm/fail.</xsd:documentation>

    <xsd:documentation xml:lang="en">This is an XML schema
            document describing the OGF NSI Connection
            Services protocol version
            1.0. The Connection Service is message
            based command protocol that
            operates between a Requester
            Network Service Agent (NSA) and a
            Provider NSA. The protocol includes
            a set of defined primitives that
            are intended to provide the control
            necessary to manage Connections.

            There are five primitives supported in this version of the
            protocol:

            1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
            connection between two STP's constrained by a certain service
            parameters.

            2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to
            setup a
            reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
            the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
            the
            requested service.

            3. Release - Provider NSA should release the
            provisioned resources
            without removing the reservation.

            4. Terminate -
            Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            and terminate
            the reservation.

            5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the
            other NSA for a
            set of connection service instances between the RA-PA
            pair.
            This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.

            6.
            ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA
            when an
            existing reservation is administratively terminated before
            the
            reservation's scheduled end-time.

            The Connection Service protocol is
            an asynchronous protocol where
            each primitive consists of three
            operations:

            1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request
            message
            such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
            NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
            the
            future.

            2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
            response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
            NSA
            that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").

            3.
            Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
            message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
            issued
            the original request message ("reserveRequest").</xsd:documentation>

    NSI Connection Services Protocol v1.0 Description: This is a draft version of service 
    definitions for the reference web services implementation of the OGF NSI Connection 
    Services Protocol v1.0. Comments and questions can be directed to the mailing list 
    group mailing list (nsi-wg@ogf.org). This document is the SOAP endpoint definition 
    for a requester NSA and holds definitions for messages the requester NSA will receive. 
    For the reserve, provision, release, and terminate message sets the requester will 
    receive confirmed and failed messages only. For the query operation a requester NSA 
    must support request, confirmed, and failed messages due to the possibility that 
    a child provider NSA may query the requester for a list of connection reservations. 
    The requester NSA may also receive the forcedEnd message.-->

  <!--OGF NSI protocol 1.0 description-->
  <wsdl:documentation>This is a web services message definition of OGF NSI
        Connection
        Services protocol version 1.0 based on an HTTP/SOAP binding.
        The
        Connection Service is message based request-response protocol
        that
        operates between a Requester Network Service Agent (NSA)
        and a Provider
        NSA. The protocol includes a set of defined
        primitives that are intended
        to provide the control necessary to
        manage Connections.

        There are five primitives supported in this version of the
        protocol:

        1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
        connection between
        two STP’s constrained by certain service
        parameters.

        2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to setup a
        reservation
        (associated with a previous reserve message) on
        the Requester NSA's
        behalf but subject to the constraints of
        the requested service.

        3. Release - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        without
        removing the reservation.

        4. Terminate - Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
        and
        terminate the reservation.

        5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the other NSA for a
        set of
        connection service instances between the RA-PA pair.
        This message can be
        used as a status polling mechanism.

        6. ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA when
        an existing
        reservation is administratively terminated before the
        reservation's
        scheduled end-time.

        The Connection Service protocol is an asynchronous protocol where
        each primitive
        consists of three operations:

        1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request message
        such as
        "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
        NSA can expect an
        response to the request at some point in
        the future.

        2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
        response message
        (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
        NSA that issued the
        original request message ("reserveRequest").

        3. Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
        message (such
        as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
        issued the original request
        message ("reserveRequest").

        To fit this asynchronous NSI protocol into a synchronous SOAP
        over HTTP binding
        we require each of the Requester and Provider
        NSA to implement SOAP end
        points. Request messages are sent from
        the Requester NSA to the Provider
        NSA's SOAP end point, while
        Confirmed and Failed messages are sent from
        the Provider NSA to
        the Requester NSA SOAP end point. In addition, each
        of the
        Request, Confirmed, and Failed operations are defined with
        input
        (request), output (acknowledgment), and fault (error)
        messages as part of
        their WSDL definition. The output message,
        or response, for each
        operation is an element definition providing a
        simple acknowledgment with
        the request correlationId.

        Note on acknowledgment handling:
        Depending on NSA implementation and thread timing
        an acknowledgment to
        a request operation may be returned after the
        confirm/fail for the
        request has been returned to the Requesting NSA.

        The following guidelines for acknowledgment handling are proposed:

        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be able to accept
        confirm/fail
        before acknowledgment.

        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before the
        confirm/fail.

        Each NSI CS request message in this WSDL definition has the
        following elements:

        correlationId - An identifier provided by the requesting
        NSA used to
        correlate to an asynchronous response from the
        responder. It is
        recommended that a Universally Unique
        Identifier (UUID) URN as per IETF
        RFC 4122 be used as a
        globally unique value.

        replyTo - The Requester NSA's SOAP end point address to which the
        asynchronous
        Confirmed or Failed message associated with this
        request will be
        delivered.

        parameters - Operation specific parameters as defined in the NSI CS
        protocol independent
        XML schema specification.</wsdl:documentation>

                        1. For protocol robustness, Requesting NSA should be
                        able to accept
                        confirm/fail before acknowledgment.

                        2. Acknowledgment should be sent by Provider NSA before

    <xsd:documentation xml:lang="en">This is an XML schema
            document describing the OGF NSI Connection
            Services protocol version
            1.0. The Connection Service is message
            based command protocol that
            operates between a Requester
            Network Service Agent (NSA) and a
            Provider NSA. The protocol includes
            a set of defined primitives that
            are intended to provide the control
            necessary to manage Connections.

            There are five primitives supported in this version of the
            protocol:

            1. Reserve - Make a request to reserve network resources for a
            connection between two STP's constrained by a certain service
            parameters.

            2. Provision - Provider NSA has been given permission to
            setup a
            reservation (associated with a previous reserve message) on
            the Requester NSA's behalf but subject to the constraints of
            the
            requested service.

            3. Release - Provider NSA should release the
            provisioned resources
            without removing the reservation.

            4. Terminate -
            Provider NSA should release the provisioned resources
            and terminate
            the reservation.

            5. Query - Mechanism for either NSA to query the
            other NSA for a
            set of connection service instances between the RA-PA
            pair.
            This message can be used as a status polling mechanism.

            6.
            ForcedEnd - An autonomous message issued from a Provider NSA
            when an
            existing reservation is administratively terminated before
            the
            reservation's scheduled end-time.

            The Connection Service protocol is
            an asynchronous protocol where
            each primitive consists of three
            operations:

            1. Request - A Requester NSA issues an operation request
            message
            such as "reserveRequest" to the Provider NSA. The Requester
            NSA can expect an response to the request at some point in
            the
            future.

            2. Confirmed - A Provider NSA sends this positive operation
            response message (such as "reserveConfirmed") to the Requester
            NSA
            that issued the original request message ("reserveRequest").

            3.
            Failed - A Provider NSA sends this negative operation response
            message (such as "reserveFailed") to the Requester NSA that
            issued
            the original request message ("reserveRequest").</xsd:documentation>
